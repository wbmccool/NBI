									<br />
									And the quacks coming from Gov. John Kasich&rsquo;s campaign jet are getting louder every day.<br />
									<br />
									What does all of this mean for the people of Ohio? Sadly, there is a cost to Kasich&rsquo;s delusions.<br />
									<br />
									Firstly, Kasich&rsquo;s quixotic campaign is costing Ohio taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. We can&rsquo;t be sure exactly how much because his administration has refused to reveal these expenses.<br />
									<br />
									Second of all, Kasich&rsquo;s constant campaigning means that no one is addressing the serious issues that Ohio is facing.<br />

									&quot;HEALTHY OHIO&quot; NOT SO HEALTHY</div>
								<p style="line-height: 20.83px; font-size: 14.67px;">
									Gov. John Kasich continues to campaign around the country claiming to be a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; and &ldquo;compassionate&rdquo; Republican, at the same time that his administration moves to implement a plan that will kick hundreds of thousands of Ohioans off of their current health coverage.<br />
									<br />
									&ldquo;George Orwell would admire the chutzpah of naming a plan that will result in hundreds of thousands of Ohioans losing their insurance coverage the &lsquo;Healthy Ohio&rsquo; plan,&rdquo; said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Healthy Ohio&rsquo; plan and health coverage snatched away from vulnerable women, children and their families will be Governor Kasich&rsquo;s legacy. Even though Governor Kasich is ducking responsibility for &lsquo;Healthy Ohio,&rsquo; the buck stops with him. He signed the budget into law that authorizes &lsquo;Healthy Ohio.&rsquo; He owns it.&rdquo;</p>

									OHIO DEMOCRAT OF THE WEEK</div>
								<p>
									<strong>This week we recognize Dr. Donald Nguyen as our Ohio Democrat of the Week for his activism on the issue of health care.<img alt="Democrat of the Week photo" src="https://ohiodems.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/14_donald_nguyen__5631___copy.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 40%; float: right;" /></strong><br />
									<br />
									Nguyen is a pediatric urologist and member of Doctors for America. Earlier this year he participated in a news conference in Dayton celebrating the sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to the ACA, 20 million previously uninsured people have gained coverage. The law has driven the uninsured rate below 10 percent -- for the first time since we started keeping records. Here in Ohio, more than 240,000 of our citizens signed up and got covered through the ACA&rsquo;s Health Insurance Marketplace in the past two years. Through the ACA&rsquo;s expansion of Medicaid, nearly 650,000 Ohioans have gained coverage through Medicaid and the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program. -- <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQD0E3oCWUw&amp;feature=youtu.be">WATCH NOW.</a></strong><br />
									<br />
									Nguyen is now taking up the fight against the &ldquo;Healthy Ohio&rdquo; proposal. According to Nguyen, the plan is a &ldquo;prescription for disaster.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;At a time when doctors and health care systems are trying to achieve the triple aim of better medical outcomes, of a more affordable and higher quality health care, the Ohio waiver is trying to do the opposite. It&rsquo;s an experiment doomed for failure as other states have seen.&quot; -- <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWdrubcCv98&amp;feature=youtu.be">WATCH NOW.</a></strong><br />
									<br />
									<strong>Thank you for fighting for affordable health care for Ohioans, Dr. Nguyen!</strong></p>
